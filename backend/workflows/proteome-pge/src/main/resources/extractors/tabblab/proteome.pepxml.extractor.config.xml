        <scalar name="MethodDetails">Utilizes MyriMatch - a tool designed to take experimental data from shotgun proteomics experiments and compare those spectra against sequences in a known database of proteins. Whether the program is being run in a single-computer environment or across an entire cluster of processing nodes, it is able to optimally divide work in a much more efficient way than many other database search programs. This is because it only generates candidate sequences from the known database once for the entire set of spectra instead of once for every spectrum. Thus, for each candidate sequence generated, it is compared against every spectrum. The spectra keep a certain (user-defined) number of candidate sequences that had the highest scores.</scalar>
